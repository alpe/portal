                In order to perform any operation (i.e. send a payment, create an offer etc.) on the stellar network,
                you need to sign with your account's secret key. Please provide your secret key below.
                Have no fear, your secret key will not leave the browser (we just store it in memory for the signing). As soon as you close this tab,
                refresh this tab or logout, your secret key will be forgotten from the browser's memory.
