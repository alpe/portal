# Lupoex Client

Lupoex (for lumen powered exchange) is the beginnings of a fully fledged trading client.
Upon looking at the trading clients already in existence we decided to focus on the visualization part to begin with.
Specifically, we wanted to give the users the ability to:
1) Search through all stellar assets
2) View Open, Low, High, Close and Volume data in a meaningful way for any asset pair.
3) View open orders for any asset pair.

In the future, we plan on adding:
1) The ability to execute trades and orders, cancel orders etc.
2) Real time updates.
